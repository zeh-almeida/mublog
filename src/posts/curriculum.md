### Title: Senior Software Engineer
### Projects:

- SAP integration with Node.js APIs using Azure for a major beverage company.

    - Responsible for analyzing requirements and breaking them down into technical documents which the team would work on. 
    
    - Once the team started work, it was my responsibility to ensure the developers had the necessary assistance, tools and knowledge to complete their assignments using pair-programming and other techniques.
    
    - As soons as the code was written, I was one of the key people necessary to approve their work, revising their code and making suggestions.
    
    - Because of the analysis phase, I was also responsible for communicating with the client and other stakeholders in order to gather as much information on the requirements possible.

    - All this work was done with international teams from multiple geographical locations.

- Developing a solution to collect data from Brazilian Health Department (ANVISA) and make it available in a data lake using AWS for a major pharmaceutical company.

   - Responsible for designing the architecture as well as implementing it. I was responsible for communicating directly with the client and stakeholders in order to gather the requirements as well as having the architecture defined and approved.
   
   - Once approved, the team and I were responsible for implementing it, using Python, AWS Step Functions and AWS Lambda running pipelines on Jenkins with Terraform.
   
   - Techniques such as pair-programming proved to be very efficient and increased the team’s productivity. Unit tests were also very important because of the data volume and data source availability.

- Architecture design of micro-services for a multi-corporation solution for a major technology conglomerate.

    - Responsible for gathering requirements, designing and validating solutions with clients and stakeholders.
    
    - One of my most curious assignments because most of what was asked to be designed already existed in the solution in a different form. 
    
    - Therefore, most of my work was not in creating new things but showing the customer how to use the solution in a more effective way, increasing it’s value.

- Development of solutions to gather data from a major financial institution in Brazil.

    - Implementation of programs to gather data from multiple sources, filter and process them in order to integrate with an external system.
