# <i class="fa-solid fa-user-astronaut"></i> About me

Hello there, my name is **José Ricardo Carvalho Prado de Almeida**.

Yes, it is a _very_ long name but we can break it into parts:

- First name: `José Ricardo`
- Middle Name: `Carvalho`
- Last Name: `Prado de Almeida`

Don't be like the US Customs and take the _"liberty"_ to change **MY** name just because it couldn't be bothered.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-house-user"></i> Personal Information

I am located in Curitiba, Paraná - Brazil but I was born in São Paulo, SP. I live in Curitiba since 2000 and during this period I was part of an Exchange Program to the USA between 2008 and 2009.

I have a dog named **Arroz**, which means "rice" in Portuguese. Sometimes he sneaks into my meetings, disrupting everyone for a while. He's **cute** so he's forgiven.

I am not married but I have a partner, [Isabela Salmazo](https://instagram.com/matercriativa) and we have the most beautiful daughter of all, **Mariana** (or Nena, as I like to call her).

I am a `developer` by love first: I **LOVE** tinkering with code, learning how things work, their meaning and importance. It's pretty much a necessity in my life to code something, really.

I love messing with `back-end development` as I personally believe this is `where the magic happens`. Yes, I have some `front-end skills` but I prefer doing things with the `green text`, if you know what I mean.

I don't care what pronouns you use to talk to me, just be polite, nice and respectful!

## <i class="fa-solid fa-briefcase"></i> Professional Information

I am a `Senior Developer` with a career spanning across 13 years as of 2023 working on multiple different systems with a large number of languages and technologies, including `.Net`, `Java` and `Python` on industries such as `Banking`, `Oil and Gas`, `Automotive`, `Healthcare`, general consulting, including others.

Since 2017 I have worked mainly as a `Senior Developer`. In this role I have analyzed requirements, drawn system architectures, written down tasks for other developers, mentored junior developers, defined processes, implemented the test pyramid paradigm and, of course, coded a lot of things as well.

Being in the fray for over a decade, I had the opportunity to work in many different companies and industries, connecting with people all over the world, making contact with many different cultures and life styles.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Closing

Currently, I have the personal objective to help other succeed in their development career as both a mentor and colleague:

> I strongly believe the best software is not written by a single person but by a very cohesive and tight team.
