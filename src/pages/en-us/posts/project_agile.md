## [>](#index) <i class="fa-solid fa-backward-fast"></i> Let's Rewind A Little Before Moving Forward

Previously I [talked about the Waterfall Project Management](project_waterfall.html) and how stiff it was: `You had to follow everything by the book or else it fails`.

> If you haven't read it, I highly recommend you to do so before continuing, I will heavily lean on it to explain my view of the `Agile Framework`.

As it is demonstrated, `Waterfall` cares more about the `result` and `process` than the `team itself`. What this means is that either the `team adapts to the project` or `the team will be changed`. While this may work with `contractors` and other `service providers`, what happens when the `team` is `part of the project itself`?

Well, things may get dicey: `people may get fired`, `the project may delay`, `people may lose motivation`, etc.

Before we suggest improvements, let's list the problems in `Waterfall` first:

 - Lack of `feedback` during the project's execution;
 - Prioritizes the `project over people`;
 - Focus heavily on `past experiences` without `awareness of the current situation`;
 - Very resistive to change;

## [>](#index) <i class="fa-solid fa-gears"></i> Get In Gear: What is Agile?

> `Agile` is a `Framework` that allows you to `embrace changes` as they come.

`Agile` is a `collection of tools` commonly named `framework` that allows one to manage a project in a way in which:

 - `Individuals and interactions` take precedence over `processes and tools`;
 - `Working results` are more valuable than `comprehensive documentation`;
 - `Collaboration` is more important than `contract negotiations`;
 - `Changes should be embraced` even whey they `don't conform to the plan`;

 That is to say, `things on the right have their value but one should prefer the things on the left`. Knowledgeable readers may correctly identify that [I have taken this straight from the Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) and I admit it, because this is **THE** place to know more about `Agile`, though in a more `Software-oriented` approach while I want to take a more generalist one.

## [>](#index) <i class="fa-solid fa-ruler-combined"></i> The twelve ~~Commandments~~ Principles of Agile

While `Agile` is indeed a `Framework` of practices, there are `twelve principles` which should always be upheld.

They are listed in the order they appear at the [Agile Manifesto page](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) and I have also tried to add examples on how to use them.

### List of Principles

- [3: Keep on Deliverin'](#keep-on-deliverin)

- [9: Attention to the Details](#attention-to-the-details)
- [10: Give It a KISS](#give-it-a-kiss)
- [11: Self Improvement Is Real](#self-improvement-is-real)
- [12: Hindsight is 20/20](#hindsight-is-2020)

### [>>](#list-of-principles) <i class="fa-solid fa-1"></i> Get Your Priorities Straight

> Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

Let's forget the `software` word for a second and change it for `items`, for a more generic purpose.

This `principle` focus on the idea that `you don't need to deliver the whole product at once` but instead `partition it into multiple parts` and `deliver one part at a time`.

Doing so will allow both the `customer` and the `team` to receive and process `feedback` easily, as there is more availability to `discuss` and `validate` the deliverable.

### [>>](#list-of-principles) <i class="fa-solid fa-2"></i> [The Wind of Change](https://open.spotify.com/track/3ovjw5HZZv43SxTwApooCM?si=44f78920c4394618)

> Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

Things change and always will: That is the principle in which the [Evolution Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution) and the [Scientific Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method) are based upon.

Instead of fighting against it, we should `embrace change` at every step. What if you planned to build yourself a `house` for a `family of 3` and `suddenly` you discover that you have a `baby coming`, would you simply `abandon the project and start over` or would you try to `make changes to it in order to accommodate the new lifestyle`?

One could argue it would `depend on how far things have progressed` and that may be a fair point but I disagree: `There is always room for adaptation` and that will make for a better `result overall`.

Going straight for the point in the `principle` itself: If you own a business of any kind, `you will do your best to keep up with the market conditions`, even if you have to `reinvent your whole business`. Isn't that embracing the change?

### [>>](#list-of-principles) <i class="fa-solid fa-3"></i> Keep on Deliverin'

> Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

The [First Principle](#get-your-priorities-straight) makes it clear we must `deliver items continuously` but how much time between each delivery makes it `continuous`?

The answer to this question really `depends on the team` as well as the `project being worked on`. When talking about `software` there tends to be a preference for `2-week cycles` but this is not a `hard rule`.

Going back to the [Waterfall article](project_waterfall.html) and the `civil construction examples`: if your team is `capable of finishing a floor foundation in two weeks`, that's your `cadence of delivery`, at least for this phase of the project.

### [>>](#list-of-principles) <i class="fa-solid fa-4"></i> One Mind, Many Hearts

> Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. 

In `Waterfall` once the `requirements` are written and approved, they never are revised. In `Agile` though, they are **constantly** being checked, rechecked and revised as many times as possible.

This ensures `the team is working towards the same goals`, always aligned.

### [>>](#list-of-principles) <i class="fa-solid fa-5"></i> The Team Makes The Dream Come True

> Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. 

In order to perform their best, people must be feeling their best. Nobody likes to work in an environment where they are just taken for granted, made fun of or generally marginalized.

`Agile` focus on people: `Your team is your greatest treasure`, take care of them.

### [>>](#list-of-principles) <i class="fa-solid fa-6"></i> Avoid E-Mails That Cloud Be a Conversation

> The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

If you have something to say, say it. `Don't communicate with means where interpretation depends on the receiver`: this may cause misunderstandings or even get lost in the process.

In order for the team to be close knitted, `they must be open and talk freely`. If there is something personal you would like to discuss, by all means get to a private place and let it out: `the best way to trust your team is to be open`.

### [>>](#list-of-principles) <i class="fa-solid fa-7"></i> How Far Are We?

> Working software is the primary measure of progress.

No matter how much bureaucracy goes through nor the amount of meetings you have: `what really counts as progress is the resolution of the problem`. 

Is the `construction` going forward? Are people building anything, have the parts arrived? That's how you check your `civil construction` progress.

### [>>](#list-of-principles) <i class="fa-solid fa-8"></i> Keeping Up the Pace

> Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

I believe this one is pretty straight forward: `If you want your team to to their best work, the pace must be constant`.

High revving or slow traffic periods may `kill productivity` because they may get the team tired and/or distracted `resulting in a demotivated team`.

### [>>](#list-of-principles) <i class="fa-solid fa-9"></i> Attention to the Details

> Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

As we `embrace changes`, we must take some time to `review previous work`. We must take good care of the `design` and `techniques` being used by the team as they may need some tweaks.

Tweaking the `tools`, `design` and `techniques` over time will allow the team to `perform better`.

### [>>](#list-of-principles) <i class="fa-solid fa-1"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-0"></i> Give it a KISS

> Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.

`KISS` means `Keep It Simple, Stupid`. The `project` and `requirements` should be easy to understand and you should't have to complicate your or the team's work needlessly. Also, getting rid of `unnecessary bureaucracy` is a **MUST** for `agile` teams to succeed.

### [>>](#list-of-principles) <i class="fa-solid fa-1"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-1"></i> Self Improvement Is Real

> The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

As the team goes along the `agile process`, it tends to become `self-organizing`. This means `the team is capable of identifying and correcting its own flaws over time`, be it `technical` or `organizational`.

Such ability also allows the team to make `better decisions, faster` which `increase the value delivered over time`.

### [>>](#list-of-principles) <i class="fa-solid fa-1"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-2"></i> Hindsight is 20/20

> At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

`For a self-organizing team to exist, it must be able to reflect on past decisions and events`. Quite easy to do, actually: it is normally called a `Retrospective`.

`Retrospectives` are events which should occur as regularly as `delivers`, so you can always iterate on the most recent achievement.

The `retrospective` should focus in `what went well`, `what didn't go well` and `how can the team improve`. Of course, `this is not a rule` and `the team is free to adapt it to use what is best for the team itself`.

Welp, you've reached this far already? Well, I haven't finished writing the whole article yet.

Probably sounds crazy to publish as-is but I want to gather feedback while I write.

After all, `agile` is all about `getting feedback`, right?
