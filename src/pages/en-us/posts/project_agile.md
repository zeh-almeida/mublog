## [>](#index) <i class="fa-solid fa-backward-fast"></i> Let's Rewind A Little Before Moving Forward

Previously I [talked about the Waterfall Project Management](project_waterfall.html) and how stiff it was: `You had to follow everything by the book or else it fails`.

> If you haven't read it, I highly recommend you to do so before continuing, I will heavily lean on it to explain my view of the `Agile Framework`.

As it is demonstrated, `Waterfall` cares more about the `result` and `process` than the `team itself`. What this means is that either the `team adapts to the project` or `the team will be changed`. While this may work with `contractors` and other `service providers`, what happens when the `team` is `part of the project itself`?

Well, things may get dicey: `people may get fired`, `the project may delay`, `people may lose motivation`, etc.

Before we suggest improvements, let's list the problems in `Waterfall` first:

 - Lack of `feedback` during the project's execution;
 - Prioritizes the `project over people`;
 - Focus heavily on `past experiences` without `awareness of the current situation`;
 - Very resistive to change;

## [>](#index) <i class="fa-solid fa-gears"></i> Get In Gear: What is Agile?

> `Agile` is a `Framework` that allows you to `embrace changes` as they come.

`Agile` is a `collection of tools` commonly named `framework` that allows one to manage a project in a way in which:

 - `Individuals and interactions` take precedence over `processes and tools`;
 - `Working results` are more valuable than `comprehensive documentation`;
 - `Collaboration` is more important than `contract negotiations`;
 - `Changes should be embraced` even whey they `don't conform to the plan`;

 That is to say, `things on the right have their value but one should prefer the things on the left`. Knowledgeable readers may correctly identify that [I have taken this straight from the Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) and I admit it, because this is **THE** place to know more about `Agile`, though in a more `Software-oriented` approach while I want to take a more generalist one.

## [>](#index) <i class="fa-solid fa-ruler-combined"></i> The twelve ~~Commandments~~ Principles of Agile

While `Agile` is indeed a `Framework` of practices, there are `twelve principles` which should always be upheld.
They are listed in the order they appear at the [Agile Manifesto page](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) and I have also added examples on how to use them.

### List of Principles

- [1: Get Your Priorities Straight](#get-your-priorities-straight)
- [2: The Wind of Change](#the-wind-of-change)
- [3: Keep on Deliverin'](#keep-on-deliverin)
- [4: One Mind, Many Hearts](#one-mind-many-hearts)
- [5: The Team Makes The Dream Come True](#the-team-makes-the-dream-come-true)
- [6: Avoid E-Mails That Cloud Be a Conversation](#avoid-e-mails-that-cloud-be-a-conversation)
- [7: How Far Are We?](#how-far-are-we)
- [8: Keeping Up the Pace](#keeping-up-the-pace)
- [9: Attention to the Details](#attention-to-the-details)
- [10: Give It a KISS](#give-it-a-kiss)
- [11: Self Improvement Is Real](#self-improvement-is-real)
- [12: Hindsight is 20/20](#hindsight-is-2020)

### [>>](#list-of-principles) <i class="fa-solid fa-1"></i> Get Your Priorities Straight

> Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

Let's forget the `software` word for a second and change it for `items`, for a more generic purpose.

This `principle` focus on the idea that `you don't need to deliver the whole product at once` but instead `partition it into multiple parts` and `deliver one part at a time`.

Doing so will allow both the `customer` and the `team` to receive and process `feedback` easily, as there is more availability to `discuss` and `validate` the deliverable.

### [>>](#list-of-principles) <i class="fa-solid fa-2"></i> [The Wind of Change](https://open.spotify.com/track/3ovjw5HZZv43SxTwApooCM?si=44f78920c4394618)

> Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

Things change and always will: That is the principle in which the [Evolution Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution) and the [Scientific Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method) are based upon.

Instead of fighting against it, we should `embrace change` at every step. What if you planned to build yourself a `house` for a `family of 3` and `suddenly` you discover that you have a `baby coming`, would you simply `abandon the project and start over` or would you try to `make changes to it in order to accommodate the new lifestyle`?

One could argue it would `depend on how far things have progressed` and that may be a fair point but I disagree: `There is always room for adaptation` and that will make for a better `result overall`.

Going straight for the point in the `principle` itself: If you own a business of any kind, `you will do your best to keep up with the market conditions`, even if you have to `reinvent your whole business`. Isn't that embracing the change?

### [>>](#list-of-principles) <i class="fa-solid fa-3"></i> Keep on Deliverin'

> Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

The [First Principle](#get-your-priorities-straight) makes it clear we must `deliver items continuously` but how much time between each delivery makes it `continuous`?

The answer to this question really `depends on the team` as well as the `project being worked on`. When talking about `software` there tends to be a preference for `2-week cycles` but this is not a `hard rule`.

Going back to the [Waterfall article](project_waterfall.html) and the `civil construction examples`: if your team is `capable of finishing a floor foundation in two weeks`, that's your `cadence of delivery`, at least for this phase of the project.

### [>>](#list-of-principles) <i class="fa-solid fa-4"></i> One Mind, Many Hearts

> Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. 

In `Waterfall` once the `requirements` are written and approved, they never are revised. In `Agile` though, they are **constantly** being checked, rechecked and revised as many times as possible.

This ensures `the team is working towards the same goals`, always aligned.

### [>>](#list-of-principles) <i class="fa-solid fa-5"></i> The Team Makes The Dream Come True

> Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. 

In order to perform their best, people must be feeling their best. Nobody likes to work in an environment where they are just taken for granted, made fun of or generally marginalized.

`Agile` focus on people: `Your team is your greatest treasure`, take care of them.

### [>>](#list-of-principles) <i class="fa-solid fa-6"></i> Avoid E-Mails That Cloud Be a Conversation

> The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

If you have something to say, say it. `Don't communicate with means where interpretation depends on the receiver`: this may cause misunderstandings or even get lost in the process.

In order for the team to be close knitted, `they must be open and talk freely`. If there is something personal you would like to discuss, by all means get to a private place and let it out: `the best way to trust your team is to be open`.

### [>>](#list-of-principles) <i class="fa-solid fa-7"></i> How Far Are We?

> Working software is the primary measure of progress.

No matter how much bureaucracy goes through nor the amount of meetings you have: `what really counts as progress is the resolution of the problem`. 

Is the `construction` going forward? Are people building anything, have the parts arrived? That's how you check your `civil construction` progress.

### [>>](#list-of-principles) <i class="fa-solid fa-8"></i> Keeping Up the Pace

> Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

I believe this one is pretty straight forward: `If you want your team to to their best work, the pace must be constant`.

High revving or slow traffic periods may `kill productivity` because they may get the team tired and/or distracted `resulting in a demotivated team`.

### [>>](#list-of-principles) <i class="fa-solid fa-9"></i> Attention to the Details

> Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

As we `embrace changes`, we must take some time to `review previous work`. We must take good care of the `design` and `techniques` being used by the team as they may need some tweaks.

Tweaking the `tools`, `design` and `techniques` over time will allow the team to `perform better`.

### [>>](#list-of-principles) <i class="fa-solid fa-1"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-0"></i> Give it a KISS

> Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.

`KISS` means `Keep It Simple, Stupid`. The `project` and `requirements` should be easy to understand and you should't have to complicate your or the team's work needlessly. Also, getting rid of `unnecessary bureaucracy` is a **MUST** for `agile` teams to succeed.

### [>>](#list-of-principles) <i class="fa-solid fa-1"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-1"></i> Self Improvement Is Real

> The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

As the team goes along the `agile process`, it tends to become `self-organizing`. This means `the team is capable of identifying and correcting its own flaws over time`, be it `technical` or `organizational`.

Such ability also allows the team to make `better decisions, faster` which `increase the value delivered over time`.

### [>>](#list-of-principles) <i class="fa-solid fa-1"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-2"></i> Hindsight is 20/20

> At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

`For a self-organizing team to exist, it must be able to reflect on past decisions and events`. Quite easy to do, actually: it is normally called a `Retrospective`.

`Retrospectives` are events which should occur as regularly as `delivers`, so you can always iterate on the most recent achievement.

The `retrospective` should focus in `what went well`, `what didn't go well` and `how can the team improve`. Of course, `this is not a rule` and `the team is free to adapt it to use what is best for the team itself`.

## [>](#index) <i class="fa-solid fa-clipboard-question"></i> What Does It Mean to be Agile?

Contrary to popular belief, `being agile is not the same as being fast`. Crazy, right?

At least in the context of `project management`, being `agile` means `being able to react to changes as soon as possible`.

This is a good contrast to `Waterfall`, where any and all changes would mean the `project termination`.

The changes handled in `agile` don't include only `project changes` but also `team-related changes` as well. This means `agile` is ready to embrace individuals `coming and going` from the team just as well as it handles `requirement changes`.

## [>](#index) <i class="fa-solid fa-puzzle-piece"></i> The Puzzling Framework

I have [already stated](#get-in-gear-what-is-agile) that `agile` is actually a `framework`, but what is that?

Essentially, a `framework` is a `collection of tools, practices and processes` but without a fixed structure.

This allows you to combine those `tools`, `practices` and `processes` in whatever way you want, as long you don't go against the [principles](#the-twelve-commandments-principles-of-agile).

This allows you to have a `tailor-made approach` as to how your team works and because of the `agile` nature, it also allows you the `flexibility to change anything, anytime`.

Of course, this can also present a challenge: `no two teams work the same way`. This amount of customization _may_ introduce some confusion as to how teams operate among each other, as they each have their own way of doing things.

At the same time, this is exactly what `agile` is good for: `Individuals and interactions`. Because the teams are `agile`, they _should_ `easily transform this perceived difficulty` into `something useful for both teams`.

## [>](#index) <i class="fa-solid fa-list-check"></i> Where Are My Deliverables?

In `Waterfall` we had many `artifacts` or `deliverables`, pretty much one for every phase. How does `agile` handles this?

The short answer is that it doesn't: `there are no artifacts in agile`, at least in principle. Maybe your team decides to output some `artifacts` but that will depend on your own goals for the `project`.

`Agile focuses on delivering value`. While some `artifacts` are important overall, they do not `directly add value` to the `project` or they may even `cost too much time to maintain`.

The `Business Rules` are a great example of this contrast between `Agile` and `Waterfall`.

In `Waterfall`, there is no turning back once the `Rules` are set and they get documented into a very thick paper tower. If, by the will of the universe, those `rules` need any kind of change, `the current version of the document must be trashed` while a new version is produced. Not only that, `the team would have to halt work on the project until such changes are made` because they cannot afford to rework on something.

In `Agile` changes are part of the daily life, therefore a update on any of the `rules` is not only expected but also welcomed. The team, `using it's own tools, practices and processes` will `find its own way to document and implement those changes seamlessly`, without adverse impact to the workflow.

In essence, everything in `agile` is decided by the `team`, including what a `deliverable` is and how to approach it.

## [>](#index) <i class="fa-solid fa-people-group"></i> The Dream Team

At this point of the article there's a sense of `too much responsibility` being at the hands of the team, but that's a `good thing`.

After all, `the team is composed of anyone of interest to the project`, even if they are not directly working on the deliverables.

In `agile` there is `less focus in what role you possess` and more in `how can you help the team succeed` which means `your job title doesn't affect how the team operates, only your actions matter`.

Let's imagine a football (soccer) team and how it works. There are 11 players in `many different positions` with `two objectives for every match`: `Score goals at the other team's goal` and `do your best to block the other team from scoring at your goal`.

In order to better organize the team, it is broken down in about 4 main groups: `offense`, `mid-field`, `defense` and `goal keeper`. Each group respects the `two main objectives` but each accomplishes them in `different ways`:

- The role of the `offense` is score goals;
- The `mid-fielders` make sure the ball reaches the `offense` and does it best to avoid the adversary's attack;
- In order to protect the goal, the `defense` is specialized in taking the ball from the adversary and performing `counter-attacks`;
- If everything fails, the `goal keeper` is the last line of defense against the adversary. The job is simple: do not let the ball get through at any cost.

`Having roles is important for a team`, it allows everyone to `know what part they should take during the match`. At the same time, `the role does not limit them to that specific position at the field`. There are no rules against a `defense player` getting the ball and scoring a goal, nor a rule against a `offense player` making a daring dribble and saving the team from taking a goal.

You also have `team members which are not directly part of the match`. This includes the `coach` and the assistants, for example. `Their job is to help the team get to the match in top-notch condition` and even `handle some unforeseen circumstances` such as strategy changes or player substitutions.

`All that matters is that all the people in the team have the same objectives`. In this case, it's to win the match, no matter what your assigned role is at the beginning.

## [>](#index) <i class="fa-solid fa-trowel-bricks"></i> Framework Pre-Fabrication

So `agile` is pretty forgivable in how you `organize your team` and `how your work is laid out` because all that matters is that you **always** follow the [principles](#the-twelve-commandments-principles-of-agile).

But does this mean you have to build your `team` workflow from scratch every time?

**Of course not!**

While `agile` is a framework and doesn't force you to follow any specific method, there are some, let's call them `implementations` of this framework which can be used out-of-the-box.

The two most common, at least for me, are:
 - [SCRUM](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum)
 - [Kanban](https://kanbanize.com/kanban-resources/getting-started/what-is-kanban)

 There are many more ways to use the `agile framework` than just those two, think of it as a `LEGO brick`.

Those two do follow the [agile principles](#the-twelve-commandments-principles-of-agile) in their own way but they are **NOT** interchangeable. `Choose them wisely before starting` because they have `very distinct ways of handling work and changes`.

## [>](#index) <i class="fa-solid fa-rocket"></i> Embrace Agility

`Agile` **does not mean** you will `deliver faster` nor `finish the project earlier`, so why choose something which seems so random instead of the structure `Waterfall` provides?

Simply put, `agile` allows you to have `better previsibility`, `better quality control` and `greater understanding of the project`.

The ability to `embrace changes` and `take care of the people` allows `agile projects` to `adapt better to changing conditions`, be it market, weather or even political ones.

## [>](#index) <i class="fa-solid fa-poo-storm"></i> Fake Agile

Not everything smells like roses, unfortunately. Because of its `framework` nature, `agile` allows people to `implement their own version` of it.

Some implementations are great such as the [examples above](#framework-pre-fabrication). Others, however, convince you they are `agile` when in fact, they are their own `flavor of doom`.

Make sure you really understand and stand behind the [agile principles](#the-twelve-commandments-principles-of-agile) before choosing or creating your `flavor of agile` or this will mean the `downfall of your project`.

Some examples of `anti-agile` methods include but are not exclusive to:

 - [eXtreme Go Horse](https://medium.com/@dekaah/22-axioms-of-the-extreme-go-horse-methodology-xgh-9fa739ab55b4) - Some people take this seriously, _why_?
 - [Waterfall](project_waterfall.html) - Yes, I had to include this because some people think you can agilize `Waterfall`: **You can't**.

## [>](#index) <i class="fa-solid fa-flag-checkered"></i> The End of the Race

 Let's conclude your `agile` adventure, shall we? I hope by now you have a good understanding on what `agile` is, how to use it and how to make it better.

 Like every tool in the universe, `it's power comes from how you use it, not from the tool itself`. You don't have to exclude `Waterfall` from your life, `it may be a powerful tool in other scenarios` but I personally think you should start thinking about `agile` first, regardless.

As always: if you have any questions or comments, send me an e-mail or message me through `Telegram`, the links are at the top of the page.

Bye for now.
