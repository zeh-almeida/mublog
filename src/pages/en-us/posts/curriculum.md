#### <i class="fa-solid fa-diagram-project"></i> Projects:

- SAP integration with Node.js APIs using Azure for a major beverage company.

    - Responsible for analyzing requirements and breaking them down into technical documents which the team would work on.

    - Once the team started work, it was my responsibility to ensure the developers had the necessary assistance, tools and knowledge to complete their assignments using pair-programming and other techniques.

    - As soon as the code was written, I was one of the key people necessary to approve their work, revising their code and making suggestions.

    - Because of the analysis phase, I was also responsible for communicating with the client and other stakeholders in order to gather as much information on the requirements possible.

    - All this work was done with international teams from multiple geographical locations.

- Developing a solution to collect data from Brazilian Health Department (ANVISA) and make it available in a data lake using AWS for a major pharmaceutical company.

   - Responsible for designing the architecture as well as implementing it. I was responsible for communicating directly with the client and stakeholders in order to gather the requirements as well as having the architecture defined and approved.

   - Once approved, the team and I were responsible for implementing it, using Python, AWS Step Functions and AWS Lambda running pipelines on Jenkins with Terraform.

   - Techniques such as pair-programming proved to be very efficient and increased the team’s productivity. Unit tests were also very important because of the data volume and data source availability.

- Architecture design of micro-services for a multi-corporation solution for a major technology conglomerate.

    - Responsible for gathering requirements, designing and validating solutions with clients and stakeholders.

    - One of my most curious assignments because most of what was asked to be designed already existed in the solution in a different form.

    - Therefore, most of my work was not in creating new things but showing the customer how to use the solution in a more effective way, increasing it’s value.

- Development of solutions to gather data from a major financial institution in Brazil.

    - Implementation of programs to gather data from multiple sources, filter and process them in order to integrate with an external system.

    - Because of the age of some sources and data complexity, many meetings with different teams had to be arranged in order to validate sources, formats and other data characteristics.

#### <i class="fa-solid fa-diagram-project"></i> Project:

- Architecture and implementation of a financial analysis workflow for a major industrial bank.
    - Responsible for designing and implementing a solution which would receive data from external systems in order to validate if a process would be approved or not.

    - This included data enrichment from internal company sources as well as external systems.

    - The implementation ran in a event-driven environment fully orchestrated in Azure using Azure Functions and ServiceBus.

    - Execution could be restarted at any point during the analysis flow in order to avoid unavailability of any external system.

    - Monitoring the execution flow in Production to evaluate possible blocks in the process.

#### <i class="fa-solid fa-diagram-project"></i> Projects:

- Development and Maintenance of the Sales Order API.
    - One of the senior developers in a Agile team using Scrum. Responsible for Developing, testing and following the project pipeline in order to finish tasks.

    - All tasks were performed with pair-programming, rotating team members every sprint in order to get in sync with the team and improve out abilities.

    - Used Java and micro-service architecture in order to implement a RESTful API as well a event-driven API using Kafka.

- Design and Implementation of a company-wide calendar event scheduler.
    - Using then-new .Net Core 3.1 and then-recently released Azure Functions v2, I was tasked to design and implement a calendar event system akin to MS Outlook with a cloud-first operation.

    - The system improved Outlook's offering as it has a waiting queue when the participation quorum was full as well as e-mail notifications when event changed, queues moved, etc.

    - The system had to work on IE11 and Chrome using the company’s Azure AD instance for authorization and authentication. The application was written with React on the front-end.

<i class="fa-regular fa-calendar"></i> 2016 - 2017

#### <i class="fa-solid fa-diagram-project"></i> Project:

- Maintenance and evolution of a ASPX-based payroll deductible loan system for a regional bank in the Paraná state.
    - System written in a monolithic approach, with many controls in ASPX and many others in Javascript/jQuery.

    - Main job was to add the capability to scan paychecks, apply OCR to the documents and read as many data as possible from the document, as this would allow a much quicker filling of the loan form as well as some value, availability and rate validations.

    - System was previously written in C#6 and MVC6, I was tasked to move it to C#7 and MVC Core.

    - OCR system was available via an external API, written mostly in XML with embedded JSON.
        - Custom parser had to be developed for this weird combination of dialects.
        - Whole OCR service communication written in a event-driven approach inside the ASPX application, using services and workers.

    - System had to communicate with legacy on-premises banking system to fetch customer information as well as calculation parameters using SOAP.

#### <i class="fa-solid fa-diagram-project"></i> Projects:

- Maintenance of the Hybris store and implementation of analytics for a major clothing industry player.
    - Several improvements to the website structure, layout, styling and overall performance of the pages, as the layout was not using a structured HTML/CSS layout such as Bootstrap. Instead, it was pretty much free form.

    - Implementation of the analytic softwares such as Chaordic and wiring the configurations at the back-end.

- Rebuild of the pages for a major tire sales company.
    - The company had many different websites, all using the same layout base.
    - However, the base layout did not account for different form factors, responsiveness or any other quality-of-life.

    - All the website structure was migrated to Bootstrap CSS in order to leverage all the quality-of-life the library provides, as well as the pre-existing components.

- Development of a Git-based versioning system used in all Hybris-based projects.
    - Projects were still using the then-outdated SVN system for source control.

    - Used the basic guidelines to establish the culture of source control, commit messages and Pull Requests.

<i class="fa-regular fa-calendar"></i> 2014 - 2015

- Maintenance of a Android app and it's web-service for vehicle inspection tailor-made for a vehicle factory park maintainer in a major factory in the Curitiba area.
    - Users took pictures of the vehicles in three distinct moments: when they left the assembly, when they were placed in the transports or in regular checks in the vehicle park where they resided.
    - The app allowed users to select specific chassis for different vehicle classes;
    - The app had to work in tablets and had to support for intermittent or simply no available networks at any time during execution.
    - Once the user finished the checklist, the data had to be uploaded to a SOAP/XML web-service with the form data as well as the pictures taken.

    - My job was to implement techniques for fault-tolerance with the web-server communication process in order not to lose any data as well as to retry if connection was lost.
    - Testing was done even in the building stairwells to ensure similar conditions before testing in the field.
    -The app was written by a third-party no longer involved with the project, with close to no documentation available.
