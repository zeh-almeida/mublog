## [>](#index) <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-rotate-left"></i> Quick Recap on Agile and Waterfall

In order to understand the [Eldritch Terror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovecraftian_horror){target="\_blank"} which is the `GoHorse GFX` approach, we must first understand what good approaches are.

And yes, I just mentioned that `Waterfall` can indeed be a good thing, deal with it. ðŸ˜Ž

### <i class="fa-solid fa-water"></i> The Waterfall

> If you want to get deep into the water, [I have already written extensively about Waterfall](project_waterfall.html){target="\_blank"} before.

`Waterfall` is a project management technique in which `each step depends directly from the one before`, with `no chance of iteration`.

While inflexible, it can be a very powerful tool for `problems with known solutions` such as `civil construction`.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-arrows-spin"></i> The Agile Framework

> For a quick feedback you may [check my article explaining the Agile Framework](project_agile.html){target="\_blank"} first.

The `Agile Framework` is about taking care of the `team` and `dealing with changes as they come`: Giving and receiving honest and clear `Feedback` is a must in order to grow and mature.

## [>](#index) <i class="fa-solid fa-warehouse"></i> <i class="fa-solid fa-horse"></i> Breeding Horses

> If you like sarcasm and want to taint your mind with the content, [check the GoHorse axioms at your own peril](https://medium.com/@dekaah/22-axioms-of-the-extreme-go-horse-methodology-xgh-9fa739ab55b4){target="\_blank"}.

`GoHorse` is **NOT** a real methodology. It is the result of fundamental lack of understanding about the `project`, `requirements` and `effort`. It may be however, the single most used _"format"_ of working in `projects` out there.

Simply put, `GoHorse` is the amalgamation of `bad practices` performed by anyone involved in the `project` that doesn't care enough about its `success`.

`Project management` is not really a science but it is a very complex area: You have to `manage people, expectations and results` in a way that is `satisfactory for your clients and stakeholders` while maintaining the `structure of the team`.

It is not simply a [_"throw money to solve"_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost){target="\_blank"} kind of problem. It requires `dedication`, `attention` and `work ethics`.

Do you realize now why `GoHorse` is so prevalent in today's world?

## [>](#index) The Anatomy of GoHorse GFX

`GoHorse GFX` tries its best to pretend to be `Agile` and normally it chooses [SCRUM](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum){target="\_blank"} as the template for its nefarious deeds.

> `SCRUM` is actually a **GREAT** `agile` implementation and you should really consider it for your `team` if you're thinking about `being agile`. As it is customary, `GoHorse` leans on this reputation in order to take a foothold and ends up tarnishing `SCRUM` as a `methodology`.

The descent to madness happens in different ways, sometimes many ways at once:

- [Separating the teams while working in the same project](#team-hierarchy)
- [Setting a delivery date for a project you haven't yet analyzed](#the-clock-keeps-ticking)
- [Making deals for the result](#the-merchant)
  - [Selling something you don't have](#to-sell-the-void)
  - [Buying something you don't understand](#if-you-bought-it-you-got-to-use-it)
- [A team too big to be self-sufficient](#overcrowding-the-team)
- [There is no problem as long as the numbers are good](#graphics-are-more-important-than-the-gameplay)
- [You have to allocate the money somewhere before it gets lost](#allocate-that-budget)
- [The rules of engagement may prevent you from doing what is best](#same-old-song-and-dance)
- [Implementing buzzwords just to appease someone somewhere](#the-advent-of-the-buzzwords)
- [Acting like you're something else](#when-you-pretend-so-much-you-start-believing-it)

### [>>](#the-anatomy-of-gohorse-gfx) <i class="fa-solid fa-arrows-split-up-and-left"></i> Team Hierarchy

Some companies will have the `technical teams` be subordinates of the `business teams`. This means that the `technical team` is not capable of having their own priorities, having to serve the `business teams` as their lords.
This makes the job of the `technical teams` very hard because they may have `changes in priorities` which they not be ready for.

Looking at the `Agile principles` of [setting your priorities](project_agile.html#get-your-priorities-straight){target="\_blank"} and [togetherness](project_agile.html#one-mind-many-hearts){target="\_blank"} is becomes clear that such an approach of having `two different backlogs` will not respect neither the `agile framework` nor `SCRUM`.

Since the `business teams` control the budget for the `projects` under the `technical teams`, they ultimately have the power to change whatever `roadmap` the `technical team` has, effectively undermining their efforts to make themselves `agile`.

### [>>](#the-anatomy-of-gohorse-gfx) <i class="fa-solid fa-stopwatch"></i> The Clock Keeps Ticking

Most things in life are cyclical: `Seasons`, `Night and Day`, `Water lifecycle`, etc. This characteristic also shows up in `businesses`: `yearly reviews`, `quarterly projections`, `yearly budget` and so on.

This flow of `checkpoints`, let's put it this way, creates an `expectation of work` to be delivered at those milestones as well.

Once you work in `very predictable` or even `repetitive projects`, it is easy to have plausible `expectations` on the `execution time` of your `project`:

- The time it takes to `paint` 1mÂ²/~11ftÂ²;
- How long does the `recipe` takes from start to finish;
- The length of the `trip` in good and bad conditions;

However, when you tackle `new` or `unexpected projects`, such as a `research` or a `software solution`, you can't **accurately** `estimate the time to completion` because you don't have enough information for it.

This is why the `agile framework` asks for the `feedback loop` in many different ways ([1](project_agile.html#hindsight-is-2020){target="\_blank"}, [2](project_agile.html#give-it-a-kiss){target="\_blank"}, [3](project_agile.html#keeping-up-the-pace){target="\_blank"}) in order to make sure `the team understand how much effort it takes to deliver something.`

It then becomes clear that any `project` created with the sole purpose of `adhering to a schedule` **will** face a lot of difficulties and it is `more likely to fail that succeed`.

### [>>](#the-anatomy-of-gohorse-gfx) <i class="fa-solid fa-money-bill-transfer"></i> The Merchant

What happens when you `sell a feature you don't have` or `buys something you have no idea how to use`?

Obviously it becomes a `project` which needs to be tackled as soon as possible because [money in on the line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost){target="\_blank"}.

#### <i class="fa-solid fa-cash-register"></i> To Sell The Void

Imagine if you will a scenario where a `sales person` is trying their best in order to `secure a client`.
In order to close the deal, the `sales person` sells a feature the `product does not support` but was key in the negotiation.

The problem now is clear: the client `expects the feature to be available` when they start to use the product and yet `such feature does not exist`.

The `company's executives` will **not** allow a sale to do under because not only does it mean `more money is coming in` but also because `cancelling the sale` could have `negative consequences to the company's reputation`.

What's the solution to this conundrum? Well, no matter how hard, difficult and exhausting it will be: `the team will have to implement this feature before the client starts using the product`.

That goes against most of the [Agile Principles](project_agile.html#the-twelve-commandments-principles-of-agile){target="\_blank"} right off the bat and is pretty much as `GoHorse` as you can make something.

#### <i class="fa-solid fa-cart-arrow-down"></i> If You Bought It, You Got To Use It

Let's try another scenario for now: let's picture an `advertisement` in which a `product` is said to solve all the `problems` you "_believe_" you have. The `product` does tick all the boxes you _think_ you need and it also looks great so let's purchase it!

Now that it was bought, how does this `product` integrate with the rest of your `solutions`? Does the team have to build some kind of `integration`? Is it `compatible` with whatever we already have?

The thing is: `it is already bought so it must be used NOW`: it doesn't matter how hard the integration is going to be, it must happen _yesterday_ because "this is a very strategical solution to us" (bet you heard _that_ before).

As in other scenarios, this `forces the team` to move into `GoHorse` territory, with no chance of sanity.

### [>>](#the-anatomy-of-gohorse-gfx) <i class="fa-solid fa-users-between-lines"></i> Overcrowding The Team

`Agile teams` [have to become self sufficient](project_agile.html#self-improvement-is-real){target="\_blank"} in order to [have high performance](project_agile.html#the-team-makes-the-dream-come-true){target="\_blank"} as well as [making sure everyone is connected](project_agile.html#avoid-e-mails-that-could-be-a-conversation){target="\_blank"}.

Those `principles` are easy to lose track of, especially if your `team` get too big. What does it really mean, `to have a team too big`? You know you have passed `critical mass` when `managers do not have enough time in their calendars to have a 15-minute conversation with their personnel at least once a month`.

Those conversations are **extremely** important because they are the only way for `managers to get some feedback` but it is not how `GoHorse` likes to operate.

In a `GoHorse` environment, the work of the `manager` is to `put out fires`. The only time your `manager` will talk to you is `when something is not right` and will probably only `criticize your work with no real feedback loop`.

If you try to `schedule a real feedback talk`, you will have to fight `hordes of meetings`, most of them taking `literal hours` to complete and many of them are `back to back`.

### [>>](#the-anatomy-of-gohorse-gfx) <i class="fa-solid fa-gamepad"></i> Graphics Are More Important Than The Gameplay

Another sign you're into a `GoHorse` situation is when the `managers` are not only `disconnected from the team's reality` but also when they start to `care more about graphics and metrics` than `actual work, feedback and people's motivation`.

This situation is very close related to [overcrowded teams](#overcrowding-the-team) as `managing large teams take a lot of work`. The "_solutions_" proposed are to `automate managerial tasks` with tools such as `feedback forms`, `mood heatmaps` and other automated tools that may generate `graphical reports` for `mass review`.

Because of the `graphical reports` the interest of `managers` changes from `taking care of the team and their well-being` to `making sure the percentages are looking good`. Working with a `team` **is not** statistical analysis, you should really be worried about **any** deviation: if a person is complaining, be sure more people are uncomfortable as well, just didn't speak up.

This _"style"_ of management takes the responsibility from the `managers` and divides it into all the people in the team: it is now `their fault` they `didn't report a problem` using the tools, not the manager's for not doing their job.

Also, the `team` may be under heavy scrutiny from `managers` if they `deviate from the standard metrics`, regardless if it is a good deviation or not: this _"style"_ of management `does not allow changes to be made`.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-maximize"></i> Allocate That Budget!

Most `projects` are born out of `need` and not exactly a `necessity`, even though they are `marketed` as such:

- Maybe your competitor is gaining on you, you have to do _something_ about it!
- Oh, the `budget allocation` is here and we need to `justify the expenses`, let's _come up with something_.
- You have always dreamt of having a house and now you got the cash, let's do it!

Of course, there are many situations in which a `project` **is** needed:

- You got to maintain your pipes and electrical installation according to the regulations;
- You got a leak in your roof;
- Maybe a newborn is in the way and you got to make some space;
- A new law got passed in which you are now required to make adjustments to your business;

There are many other scenarios which a `project` is a valid solution, _this list is not even close to being exhaustive_.

Since some `projects` are more of a desire than a necessity, they end up poorly planned. At least in my experience as a `software engineer` this is so very common it is kind of an `industry joke` at this point.

Regularly `big companies` have `budget adjustments` which are often close to the end of their `fiscal year`. Sectors do their best to `use all the money they have available` before the reviews in order to `justify their need for more money` for the next year. it's in situations like this a bunch of `filler projects` are created, only to `allocate surplus budget`.

As you may have guessed, this is a prime scenario for `useless projects` to be born. Their sole purpose is to have budget allocated, **not** to succeed. Of course, a `project which is not meant to succeed can only fail` but it _mustn't_ or the `budget gets deallocated` and may not be available after the review.

What ends up happening is something close to the [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost){target="\_blank"}: you avoid stopping the investment because you are already so deep into it but in order to justify past expenses, you keep spending more.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-repeat"></i> Same Old Song and Dance

Not only `budget constraints` cause `GoHorse projects` to exist. Sometimes `inertia` may play against the `projects` as well.

There are many businesses which are multiple decades old and are still going strong. Sure, they _may_ have gotten a `rebranding` here, maybe broken up in `smaller entities` there but in essence, they still have that old spirit in them.

This is to say, they have a `lot of baggage`: companies like this have done all kinds of deals, survived (or at least partially) many different regulations and so many more political changes.

Such businesses may have `strict rules on how to engage` projects, ventures, deals and competitors. Of course, `such rules would apply themselves to all areas of the company`, with no regard as to how each area operates because it is all for the good of the company, after all.

As you may have guessed by the hints I left, those strict rules may `prevent` companies from `reaching new markets`, `improving their offers` or just simply keep with the times and, when applied to `projects` may interfere negatively in the outcome.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-book"></i> The Advent of the Buzzwords

[Buzzwords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzzword){target="\_blank"} have the habit of using an important word or term and `diluting` their meaning.

`Agile` is one of the victims, as the `buzzword version` of `agile` tries to convince the reader it is `fast`, `modern`, is `always better` and will `generate profit by itself` (which _may_ actually happen but only if you adhere to the [principles](project_agile.html#the-twelve-commandments-principles-of-agile){target="\_blank"}). Of course, the `buzzword` doesn't care about the `principles` as it is just a conversation tool, to embellish the contents of the speech.

At the same time, `buzzwords` caused a real problem to `old-fashioned business`: People `started using those words` and `some of those people even knew what they really meant`. Coupled with the fact that some business `were pretty successful` using some of the `buzzwords` the right way, the trend was set: We must now make ourselves `agile`.

To better illustrate my point, here's a list of some `buzzwords` you probably seen before:

- `Synergy`
- `New normal`
- `Artificial Intelligence`
- `Cloud-first`
- `Holistic`
- `Big data`

In the `right context`, most of those words are actually `useful and have a significant meaning ` but when used as a `buzzwords` they are worthless.

None of the `C-suite` executives really understood what `Agile` means but the dear reader might: a very meticulous revision of the company culture, from top to bottom, left to right. It is simply not possible to work with an `agile team stuck in a non-agile environment` for a long period so either the `company embraces agile` or it pretends.

### When You Pretend So Much You Start Believing It

The transition to `agile` is not an easy path. You have to **meticulously analyze** your processes and directives in order to ensure they `embrace change` and `feedback`.

Most businesses work close to the `Waterfall` approach: `things get done by one department and are forwarded to the next`. However, no single person knows how the company operates and how its processes are integrated, nor are those processes really documented nor updated. Finding those `artifacts` and `checking if they really are up to date is a daunting task` that most businesses ignore until it is too late.

If you have ever worked in any office, you are aware of the existence of the `One Person`. That is, `the person which knows how everything is done` and without this single person the company would go under or something similar.

When `agile` is to be implemented in places like this, the strong contrast between approaches causes a lot of clashes with the `culture of the company`. Since the `agile framework` allows one to construct their own _"flavor"_ of `agile`, companies such as those end up creating a methodology which draws inspiration from both `their old ways` as well as `agile` but without the respect for the `principles`.

The result is the abomination I like to call the `GoHorse GFX`, which is not `agile` but people pretend it is.

## [>](#index) <i class="fa-solid fa-trophy"></i> There Are No Victors In This Race

I must apologize if you got this far into this article. You were probably triggered by some of the contents but I feel that people need to recognize `GoHorse` and get rid of it as soon as possible.

I have named this article `GoHorse GFX` because of the [graphical style](#graphics-are-more-important-than-the-gameplay) I have seen going around, I myself got caught in some `projects` using this.

But hey, **there really is a light at the end of the tunnel**: make sure you also [know the agile framework](project_agile.html){target="\_blank"} and even the [waterfall method](project_waterfall.html) too, why not?

Make sure you understand them and fight for them: only you can stop `GoHorse` from being a regular occurrence in your life.

Thank you!
